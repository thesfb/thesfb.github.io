I’m **Sudhanshu Bhardwaj**, a Computer Science and Systems Engineering undergraduate with a strong focus on **backend systems, security, and applied cryptography**.

My work sits at the intersection of **systems engineering, cybersecurity, and infrastructure-level problem solving**. I’m interested in how real systems fail, how they’re exploited, and how to design them to fail less often.

I’ve led and built security-focused initiatives at the student and project level — from organizing large-scale Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to developing tools for vulnerability analysis, identity misuse detection, and legacy system auditing.

### What I work on
- Backend systems in **Go, Python, Rust**
- Vulnerability research, penetration testing, and code audits
- Blockchain and Web3 security (Solana, Move, smart contracts)
- Applied AI for security and forensic analysis


### Notable Work
- Built an AI-driven system for **identity theft, impersonation, and smear campaign detection**
- Developed a **legacy code analysis platform** to identify outdated dependencies and vulnerabilities
- Engineered a **Rust-based TUI application** focused on speed, keyboard-first workflows, and reliability

### Outside formal work
I enjoy digging into:
- operating systems and low-level abstractions  
- surveillance and forensic technologies  
- cryptography beyond surface-level usage  
- writing to clarify thinking, not to perform

This blog is where I document ideas, breakdowns, and things I’ve learned while building or breaking systems.
